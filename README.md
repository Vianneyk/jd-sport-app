# How to setup and run the project

## Step 1 - Dependencies

You will need:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) (Optional. Not Required if you use NPM)

Please install them if you don't have them already.

## Step 2 - Clone the repository:

From the command line, clone the repository.

## Step 3 Install Each Lesson

Each section is a separate app using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). This repo has a script to install all of them at once.

If you are using yarn run from the root of the repository:

```sh
yarn
```

If you are using npm, run from the root of the repository:

```sh
npm run install
```

## Step 4 - Run an app

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the app:

```sh
cd client
yarn start
# or
npm start
```

Your browser should open up to a running app.
